# 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist - Dugsi Stripe Integration

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Review Complete

### 1. Code Quality & Security ✅

- [x] **Webhook Signature Verification**: All webhooks verify Stripe signature
- [x] **Idempotency Protection**: WebhookEvent model prevents duplicate processing
- [x] **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated (email, child count, etc.)
- [x] **SQL Injection Protection**: Using Prisma parameterized queries
- [x] **Type Safety**: TypeScript with proper type checking
- [x] **Error Handling**: Appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 500)
- [x] **Transaction Safety**: Database operations wrapped in transactions

### 2. Database ✅

- [x] **Schema Updated**: All Dugsi fields added as nullable (backward compatible)
- [x] **Indexes Added**: Performance indexes on familyReferenceId and stripeCustomerIdDugsi
- [x] **WebhookEvent Model**: Idempotency tracking with unique constraint
- [x] **Migration Ready**: Schema changes already applied to production

### 3. Environment Variables Required 🔐

```env
# Add these to your production environment:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_DUGSI=sk_live_xxx          # From Dugsi Stripe Dashboard
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_DUGSI=whsec_xxx        # From Dugsi webhook endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK_DUGSI=https://buy.stripe.com/xxx  # Your $1 payment link
```

### 4. Stripe Dashboard Configuration ✅

- [x] **Webhook Endpoint**: Configured at https://irshadcenter.com/api/webhook/dugsi
- [x] **Events Selected**:
  - checkout.session.completed
  - customer.subscription.created
  - customer.subscription.updated
  - customer.subscription.deleted
  - invoice.payment_succeeded
  - invoice.payment_failed
- [x] **Payment Link**: $1 payment link created
- [x] **Test Mode**: Tested successfully

### 5. Build & Deployment ✅

- [x] **Build Successful**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- [x] **TypeScript Compilation**: No type errors
- [x] **API Routes**: /api/webhook/dugsi properly compiled

## 🚨 Important Considerations

### Console Logging

**Current State**: 13 console.log statements in webhook handler for debugging
**Recommendation**: Keep for initial production monitoring, remove after stable

```javascript
// These help track webhook flow in production logs:
console.log(`🔔 Dugsi webhook received: ${event.type}`)
console.log(`✅ Payment method captured for family: ${familyId}`)
```

### Error Response Strategy

The webhook intelligently returns different status codes:

- **200**: For data issues (prevents Stripe retry)
- **401**: For signature failures (security issue)
- **500**: For server errors (triggers Stripe retry)

This is **CORRECT** and should not be changed.

### Idempotency Protection

The system will:

1. Check if event was already processed
2. Skip if duplicate
3. Clean up failed events for retry

This is **CRITICAL** for payment processing integrity.

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Variables

```bash
# Add to your production environment (Vercel/Heroku/etc):
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_DUGSI=sk_live_[your_key]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_DUGSI=whsec_[your_secret]
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK_DUGSI=https://buy.stripe.com/[your_link]
```

### Step 2: Deploy Code

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/multi-stripe
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. Check build logs for any errors
2. Test webhook endpoint: `curl -I https://irshadcenter.com/api/webhook/dugsi`
3. Should return 405 (Method Not Allowed for GET)

### Step 4: Test Production Flow

1. Register a test family at /dugsi/register
2. Complete $1 payment with **real card** (production mode)
3. Check database for `paymentMethodCaptured: true`
4. Create test subscription in Stripe Dashboard
5. Verify subscription links to family

## ⚠️ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# Quick rollback
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or redeploy previous version in your hosting platform
```

## 🔍 Monitoring After Deployment

### First 24 Hours

- [ ] Monitor error logs for webhook failures
- [ ] Check Stripe Dashboard webhook success rate
- [ ] Verify families can complete registration
- [ ] Confirm payment method capture works
- [ ] Test manual subscription linking

### Success Metrics

- Webhook success rate > 99%
- No duplicate payment processing
- All families get payment method captured
- Manual subscriptions link correctly

## ✅ System Architecture Validation

### Isolation from Mahad ✅

- Separate Stripe clients (mahad vs dugsi)
- Separate webhook endpoints (/api/webhook vs /api/webhook/dugsi)
- Separate database fields (stripeCustomerId vs stripeCustomerIdDugsi)
- Explicit program filters in all queries

### Payment Flow ✅

1. Family registers children → familyReferenceId links them
2. $1 payment → Captures payment method
3. Webhook updates database → paymentMethodCaptured = true
4. Admin creates subscription → Manual in Stripe Dashboard
5. Admin links subscription → Updates family records

### Security Features ✅

- Webhook signature verification
- Idempotency protection
- Input validation
- Transaction safety
- Proper error handling

## 🎯 Production Ready Status

**✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

The system has been:

- Thoroughly tested
- Security reviewed
- Performance optimized
- Error handling implemented
- Idempotency protected
- Isolation verified

### Remaining Tasks After Deployment:

1. Monitor initial production webhooks
2. Create admin documentation for subscription management
3. Train staff on manual subscription creation
4. Consider adding admin UI for subscription linking (future enhancement)
