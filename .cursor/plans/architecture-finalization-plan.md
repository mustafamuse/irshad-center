## Remaining Work

### Phase 6: Dugsi Admin Server/Client Optimization (Following Cohorts Pattern)

**Goal**: Refactor Dugsi admin to follow the same architecture patterns as `/admin/mahad/cohorts` - splitting into feature-based components with proper Server/Client separation.

**Reference Pattern**: `/admin/mahad/cohorts` structure:

- Server Component page with parallel data fetching
- Suspense boundaries for each section
- Error boundaries for each section
- Feature-based component organization
- Zustand store for UI-only state
- Smaller, focused Client Components

**Current State:**

- `page.tsx` is Server Component ✅ (matches pattern)
- `dugsi-dashboard.tsx` is a large Client Component (~500 lines)
- All state management and UI in one component
- No Suspense boundaries
- No feature-based organization

**Target State:**

- Follow cohorts pattern exactly:
  - Server Component page with parallel data fetching (if needed)
  - Suspense boundaries for each major section
  - Error boundaries for each section
  - Feature-based component folders
  - Zustand store for UI state (filters, selections, dialogs)
  - Smaller, focused Client Components

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create Zustand Store for UI State**
   - File: `app/admin/dugsi/store/ui-store.ts`
   - Move all UI state (filters, selections, dialog states) to store
   - Follow pattern from `app/admin/mahad/cohorts/store/ui-store.ts`
   - Include selectors and legacy action compatibility layer

2. **Organize Components by Feature**
   - Create feature folders following cohorts pattern:
     - `components/dashboard/` - Main dashboard sections
       - `dashboard-header.tsx` - Header with view mode toggle
       - `dashboard-stats.tsx` - Stats cards (can be Server Component)
       - `dashboard-filters.tsx` - Search and filter bar
       - `dashboard-content.tsx` - Tabs and content area
       - `index.tsx` - Exports
     - `components/family-management/` - Family-related features
       - `family-grid-view.tsx` (already exists, move here)
       - `family-status-badge.tsx` (already exists, move here)
       - `family-card.tsx` - Extract from grid view
       - `index.tsx` - Exports
     - `components/registrations/` - Registration table features
       - `registrations-table.tsx` (already exists, move here)
       - `registrations-filters.tsx` - Extract filtering logic
       - `index.tsx` - Exports
     - `components/dialogs/` - All dialogs
       - `delete-family-dialog.tsx` - Extract delete dialog
       - `link-subscription-dialog.tsx` (already exists, move here)
       - `bulk-actions-dialog.tsx` - For bulk actions (future)
       - `index.tsx` - Exports
     - `components/quick-actions/` - Quick action components
       - `quick-actions-bar.tsx` (already exists, move here)
       - `index.tsx` - Exports
     - `components/ui/` - Shared UI components
       - `parent-info.tsx` (already exists, move here)
       - `index.tsx` - Exports

3. **Update Page Component**
   - File: `app/admin/dugsi/page.tsx`
   - Add Suspense boundaries for each major section
   - Add Error boundaries (using existing `DugsiErrorBoundary`)
   - Wrap in `Providers` if needed
   - Follow pattern from `app/admin/mahad/cohorts/page.tsx`

4. **Refactor Main Dashboard**
   - File: `app/admin/dugsi/components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`
   - Break down into smaller components
   - Use Zustand store for state
   - Compose feature components together

5. **Add Loading States**
   - Create loading skeletons for each section
   - Follow pattern from cohorts

**Files to Create:**

- `app/admin/dugsi/store/ui-store.ts` - Zustand store for UI state
- `app/admin/dugsi/store/index.ts` - Store exports
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dashboard/dashboard-header.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dashboard/dashboard-stats.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dashboard/dashboard-filters.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dashboard/index.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/family-management/index.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/registrations/index.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dialogs/delete-family-dialog.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dialogs/index.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/quick-actions/index.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/ui/index.tsx`
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/index.tsx` - Main exports

**Files to Move:**

- `components/family-grid-view.tsx` → `components/family-management/family-grid-view.tsx`
- `components/family-status-badge.tsx` → `components/family-management/family-status-badge.tsx`
- `components/dugsi-registrations-table.tsx` → `components/registrations/registrations-table.tsx`
- `components/link-subscription-dialog.tsx` → `components/dialogs/link-subscription-dialog.tsx`
- `components/quick-actions-bar.tsx` → `components/quick-actions/quick-actions-bar.tsx`
- `components/parent-info.tsx` → `components/ui/parent-info.tsx`

**Files to Modify:**

- `app/admin/dugsi/page.tsx` - Add Suspense/Error boundaries
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dugsi-dashboard.tsx` - Refactor to use feature components and store
- `app/admin/dugsi/components/dugsi-stats.tsx` - Can potentially be Server Component

   - Route organization principles

3. **Component Patterns Documentation**
   - File: `docs/COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md`
   - Server Component patterns
   - Client Component patterns
   - When to use each

4. **Update README Files**
   - Update root `README.md` with new structure
   - Ensure all `README.md` files in admin directories are accurate

### Phase 8: Final Cleanup & Review

**Goal**: Ensure consistency across the entire codebase.

**Tasks:**

1. **Verify All Redirects**
   - Check `/batches` redirect works
   - Check `/admin/attendance` redirect works
   - Test navigation links

2. **Review Import Paths**
   - Ensure all imports use correct paths
   - Check for outdated references

3. **Verify Middleware**
   - Ensure protected routes are correct
   - Remove any outdated route references

4. **Code Consistency**
   - Check naming conventions
   - Verify error handling patterns
   - Ensure loading states are consistent
