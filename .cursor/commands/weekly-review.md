# Weekly review

- Go through all my commits for the past 7~10 days (on the main repo branch). Note: I must be the author of the commits using my email (git config user.email)
  - Ask me to set my user email if you can't find it. Explain me how to set my email
- Create a very short synthesis of everything that I shipped based on the commits
- Print 2~5 bullet points explaining my changes
- Also, highlight what you believe was tech debt, what seemed like bug fixes, and what looked like net new functionality in a short paragraph at the end
